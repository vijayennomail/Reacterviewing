### Welcome to Reacterviewing, the repo with surprisingly little in it

If you're applying for an React Native development position at Ennovations Techserv then this is the repo for you!

### Instructions
Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to show an album title and image in a listing view. The album title and image should be retrieved from [https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/). 

 baseURL = "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/"
 
 photosEndpoint = "/photos" //returns photos and their album ID
 
 albumsEndpoint = "/albums" //returns an album, but without photos

BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS:
- Remove all occurances of the letter "e" (case-insensitive) from album titles

You are free to code *anything* about the  code so long as you accomplish this goal. Make it read and function the way you want it to, but bear in mind we‚Äôre looking for people who understand what best industry practices look like in React Native.


Feel Free to Ask If you Have Any Queries Regarding Instructions

All The Best ! üëçüèª
